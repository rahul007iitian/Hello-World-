# Hello-World-
My first repositry.

 This year challenge is to build a break through technology which can perdict and prevent the impact of natural disaster. Our project is to 
 contribute in the prevention of death and losses which comes due to hurricane. It is a tropical cyclone of rapidly rotating storm system  
 that is referred by different names in different regions.
          Basically the threat to the life mainly comes due to the time taken in the prediction and to communicate it to the people. 
  Our app will help people not only in providing them the impact of upcoming disaster but also it includes the technology that will infom the 
  authorities related, about the need of the people.
   Points to ponder about our app:
      A). Before the hurricane strikes our app can help :
        a). Our app will directly linked to the weather forecast authorities, that will authomatically alert people that are going to be affected
         by its impact.
         b). We will also link our app with the tourist companies, So that if people goes to the tourist places that are prone to the hurricane
          area they register to our app, So that we have the information about him or to whom we have to contact in urgent cases.
         c). Provide the locaiton of the nearest safer zone or camp, so that they can safe themsleves.
         
      B). After the hurricane has striked the region:
        a) If hurricane has striked then we will provide the tips and trick from time to time through the app for saving the people.
        b)Our app will be linked to the rescue authorities such as NGO and other who wants to save the victim of hurricane.
        c) Our app will also provide the facility, that if someone had been stuck in the situation, then their friend or guardian register
         the relative information on our app. This will provide a great help for the rescuer and the person to be rescued.
